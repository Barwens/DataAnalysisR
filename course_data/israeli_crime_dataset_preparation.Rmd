Our first step is to load the different datasets:
```{r loading data}
# Please change the paths as needed
library(readr)
# Loading crime data for years 2011-13:
df.crime <- read_csv("/Users/lee/Dropbox (Personal)/School/52414/2017 Course Git/DataAnalysisR/course_data/israel_crime_list_11_to_13_english.csv")
# Loading town english names:
df.names <- read_csv("/Users/lee/Dropbox (Personal)/School/52414/2017 Course Git/DataAnalysisR/course_data/israeli_towns_names_and_numbers.csv")
#loading murder data for town type:
df.murder <- read_csv("/Users/lee/Dropbox (Personal)/School/52414/2017 Course Git/DataAnalysisR/course_data/israel_murder_05_09_english.csv")
# loading population data:
df.population <- read_csv("/Users/lee/Dropbox (Personal)/School/52414/2017 Course Git/DataAnalysisR/course_data/israel_population.csv")
```
Once the different datasets are loaded, we can join the necessary fields to the crime data:
```{r joining columns}
#joining the English town names to the crime data:
library("plyr")
df.crime.full <- join(df.crime, df.names, by = c("town_number"), type = "left", match = "all")
#joining the total population size per town to the crime data:
df.crime.full <- join(df.crime.full, df.population[c('town_number','total')], by = c("town_number"), type = "left", match = "all")
#joining the town type to the crime data:
df.crime.full <- join(df.crime.full, df.murder[c('town_h','town_type')], by = c("town_h"), type = "left", match = "all")
```
