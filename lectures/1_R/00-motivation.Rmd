# A Short Primer on R  
The programming language of this course is the 
[R software environment](https://cran.r-project.org/)

#### Why R? Pros:
* R's strong package ecosystem (libraries) 
* Out of the box native Graphical benefits
* Râ€™s close ties to the academia (R's community) 
* Best suited for people that have data-oriented problems they're trying to solve
* Interactive language: high-level and intuitive 
* Data structures primitives for data analysis
* R is free!
* Excellent documentation


#### Why not R? Cons:
* R's shortcomings in speed, security and memory management
* R emanates from programming languages built in the 1960s by Bell labs, somewhat outdated today
* Not a deployment language  

However, many of R's packages (libraries) are written in fast and efficient languages (such as in C, C++)  


### R Ecosystem
* CRAN: a repository for R packages, mirrored worldwide.  
* R-help: StackExchange, StackOverflow and CrossValidated sites
* Bioconductor: A CRAN-like repository dedicated to the life sciences.
* Neuroconductor: A CRAN-like repository dedicated to neuroscience, and neuroimaging.
* Books: Many academic books are written in R. 
* The [Israeli-R-user-group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/israel-r-user-group) 
* RStudio: Written in JavaScript, the RStudio IDE is the most popular and powerful IDE for R.
